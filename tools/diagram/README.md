# State Transition Diagram
## Vending Machine
Here is a [state diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram) generated by [Z.ai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z.ai) for a standard **Vending Machine** logic.

In this example:
*   **Product Cost:** 25 cents
*   **Accepted Coins:** Nickel (5¢), Dime (10¢), Quarter (25¢)
*   **The Machine** waits for payment, dispenses a drink when enough money is collected, and gives change if necessary.

    [*] --> Idle

    state Idle {
        [*] --> Waiting
        Waiting --> Dispensing: Insert 25¢
        Waiting --> Five_Cents: Insert 5¢
        Waiting --> Ten_Cents: Insert 10¢
    }

    state Five_Cents {
        [*] --> 5
        5 --> Dispensing: Insert 20¢
        5 --> Five_Cents: Insert 5¢
        5 --> Ten_Cents: Insert 5¢
    }

    state Ten_Cents {
        [*] --> 10
        10 --> Dispensing: Insert 15¢
        10 --> Five_Cents: Insert 5¢
        10 --> Ten_Cents: Insert 10¢
    }

    state Fifteen_Cents {
        [*] --> 15
        15 --> Dispensing: Insert 10¢
        15 --> Five_Cents: Insert 5¢
        15 --> Ten_Cents: Insert 5¢
    }

    state Twenty_Cents {
        [*] --> 20
        20 --> Dispensing: Insert 5¢
        20 --> Five_Cents: Insert 5¢
        20 --> Ten_Cents: Insert 5¢
    }

    state Dispensing {
        [*] --> Release_Drink
        Release_Drink --> Give_Change: Total > 25¢
        Release_Drink --> Idle: Total = 25¢
    }

    state Give_Change {
        [*] --> Return_Coin
        Return_Coin --> Idle
    }

    note right of Waiting
        Current Balance: 0¢
        Waiting for coin...
    end note

    note right of Dispensing
        Balance reached!
        Dispense product.
        Check for change.
    end note
```

### Explanation of States & Transitions

Here is the logic represented in the diagram above:

#### 1. The States
*   **Idle / Waiting (0¢):** The machine is ready. The balance is 0.
*   **Five_Cents (5¢):** Total money inserted is 5¢.
*   **Ten_Cents (10¢):** Total money inserted is 10¢.
*   **Fifteen_Cents (15¢):** Total money inserted is 15¢.
*   **Twenty_Cents (20¢):** Total money inserted is 20¢.
*   **Dispensing:** The target amount (25¢) has been reached or exceeded. The machine releases the product.
*   **Give Change:** If the user inserted more than 25¢ (e.g., three dimes), this state returns the excess coins before resetting.

#### 2. The Transitions (Logic)
*   **Insert Nickel (+5¢):** Moves the machine to the next higher state (e.g., 0¢ $\rightarrow$ 5¢ $\rightarrow$ 10¢).
*   **Insert Dime (+10¢):** Jumps the machine forward two states (e.g., 5¢ $\rightarrow$ 15¢).
*   **Insert Quarter (+25¢):** From the Idle state, this immediately triggers the **Dispensing** state.
*   **Dispensing $\rightarrow$ Give Change:** Occurs if the total balance was strictly greater than 25¢.
*   **Give Change / Dispensing $\rightarrow$ Idle:** Resets the machine balance to 0 for the next customer.

## Elivator

Here is a state diagram representing the logic of a standard elevator system.

This diagram focuses on the high-level states of the elevator's lifecycle: waiting, moving, and handling the doors.

### State Diagram (Mermaid)

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle

    state Idle {
        [*] --> Doors_Open
        Doors_Open --> Doors_Closing: Request received for different floor
    }

    state Moving {
        [*] --> Moving_Up
        [*] --> Moving_Down
        Moving_Up --> Moving_Up: Passing floors (no request)
        Moving_Down --> Moving_Down: Passing floors (no request)
    }

    state Arrival {
        [*] --> Doors_Opening
    }

    Idle --> Moving: Doors closed & Target > Current
    Idle --> Moving: Doors closed & Target < Current

    Moving --> Arrival: Arrived at requested floor

    Arrival --> Idle: Doors fully open
    
    note right of Idle
        Initial state.
        Elevator waits with doors open.
    end note

    note left of Moving
        Elevator travels to the 
        target floor, potentially
        stopping for intermediate
        requests.
    end note
```

### State Descriptions

1.  **Idle (Doors Open)**
    *   **Description:** The elevator is stationary at a floor. The doors are open to allow passengers to enter or exit.
    *   **Transition:** If a passenger presses a button for a different floor (inside the cab or in the hallway), the system triggers the "Closing" sequence.

2.  **Closing Doors**
    *   **Description:** The transition state where doors shut.
    *   **Transition:** Once sensors confirm the doors are fully closed, the logic determines the direction (Up or Down) based on the requested floor.

3.  **Moving Up / Moving Down**
    *   **Description:** The motor is engaged, and the elevator is traveling.
    *   **Transition:** The elevator remains in this state until it reaches a floor where a stop has been requested (either by a passenger inside or a hall call).

4.  **Opening Doors (Arrival)**
    *   **Description:** The elevator has arrived at a destination floor and the doors are opening.
    *   **Transition:** Once fully open, the system returns to the **Idle** state to wait for new inputs.

### Simplified Textual Flow

1.  **System Start** $\rightarrow$ **Idle** (Doors Open).
2.  **Request Input** (e.g., "Floor 5") $\rightarrow$ **Closing Doors**.
3.  **Doors Closed** $\rightarrow$ **Moving Up** (Assuming current floor is lower than 5).
4.  **Pass Floor 3** (No request) $\rightarrow$ Stay in **Moving Up**.
5.  **Arrive Floor 5** $\rightarrow$ **Opening Doors**.
6.  **Doors Open** $\rightarrow$ **Idle**.
